            Be careful with these settings, email is the only means of notifying 
            you of new activity when not online. 
          %li 
            You will not receive any email notifications while your 
            status is online.
          %li 
            You will receive 1 email notification when all your notifications 
            are marked as read and your status is offline.
          %li 
            If you have unread notification messages, 
            you will not receive another email until your
            [Send after] setting, times out.
